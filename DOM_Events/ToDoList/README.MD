## 🧠 How It Works
When the page loads, existing tasks are fetched from localStorage.
Adding a task creates a new object with id, text, and completed status.
Tasks are dynamically rendered with:

- ✔️ Complete button (toggles task status)

- 🗑️ Delete button (removes task)

- All actions update localStorage to keep data persistent.
